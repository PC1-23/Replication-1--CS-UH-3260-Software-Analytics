## About RQ2 Replication Dataset Notes

The original dataset contained outdated repos that no longer exist, or PR's that have been deleted, as well as some records were not formated properly according to the CSV format. We do not know the reasons behind these errors, and thus, the final decision was to remove such entries from the dataset, as we can't guarantee that fixing these issues is possible or that our fixes wouldn't impact on the replication results. You can find the changed dataset in `Selected Merged PRs with code readabiliy improvements (copy).csv`. Additional details on how it was used will be described in `notes`.
